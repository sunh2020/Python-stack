# Python-stack

This is for full Python stack projects I've learned from Coding Dojo.

I've used Python, Flask, Django and SQLite for projects.

The weather app is in Django folder is my personal project I've cloned watching Youtube. 

It is desktop app that shows temperature, wind and current local time.
